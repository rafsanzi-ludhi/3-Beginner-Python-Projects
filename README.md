# Password Generator

## Introduction

This project serves as my exploration into Python programming, diving into various core concepts and syntax of the language. Although I have experience with Angular, Python presented a new and exciting challenge, particularly its syntax and operation style.

## About the Project

A password generator implemented in Python. This project allows users to generate passwords based on specified criteria, including length and the inclusion of numbers and special characters, providing an additional layer of security through customizability.

## Features

- Generate random passwords with user-specified minimum length.
- Option to include/exclude numbers in the generated password.
- Option to include/exclude special characters in the generated password.

## What I Learned

### Python Basics

- **Syntax and Operations**: Understood and implemented basic Python syntax and operations.
  
### Libraries and Modules

- **Using Python Libraries**: Learned how to utilize Python's `random` and `string` modules.
  
### Programming Concepts
  
- **Conditional Statements and Loops**: Grasped and applied conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) and loops (`while`) in Python.
- **Functions**: Defined and utilized Python functions, understanding parameter usage and return statements.
  
### User Interaction

- **User Input and Validation**: Managed user input and performed basic input validation to ensure accurate user data.
  
### Security Insights
  
- **Password Complexity**: Gained insights into password complexity and the significance of involving different character types (letters, numbers, special characters) in secure password generation.


## Future Improvements

While this project serves its primary purpose, there is always room for improvement and additional learning. Future iterations may involve:

- Implementing a GUI for enhanced user interaction.
- Allowing users to specify upper and lower case requirements.
- Implementing additional security features, like avoiding similar-looking characters.
- Providing an option for users to save the generated password securely.
